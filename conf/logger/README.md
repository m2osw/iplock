# Changing Logger Settings

You can change logger settings by adding files in this sub-directory.

The files have to be named:

    ??-logger.conf

    # or

    ??-ipload.conf
    ??-iplock.conf
    ??-ipwall.conf
    ??-knock-knock.conf

Where `??` represents a number from 00 to 99. In general, the administrator
should use 50. 00 is reverved for this project. Other projects may use other
numbers.
