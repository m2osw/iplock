.TH IPLOAD 1 "August 2022" "ipload 1.x" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
ipload \- Load your firewall on boot
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/share/iplock/ipload/<name>.conf
and
.B /etc/iplock/ipload/<name>.conf
and
.B /etc/iplock/ipload/iplock.d/??-<name>.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBipload(1)\fR tool runs once at boot time in order to load the firewall
definitions in your iptables firewall before your network goes up.
.PP
The following documents the format of the configuration file supported by
the \fBipload(1)\fR tool.

.SH ORGANIZATION
The \fBipload(1)\fR tool loads all the files and look for a specific set
of options as defined below. All the files are loaded first. Then the
data gets organized in \fITables\fR, \fIChains\fR, \fISections\fR, and
\fIRules\fR. The \fISections\fR is a concept added by \fBipload(1)\fR
to ease the defining the order in which your rules get added to the
firewall.
.PP
The names of the \fITables\fR are the same as defined in \fBiptables(8)\fR:
.RS
.IP \fBfilter\fR
.IP \fBnat\fR
.IP \fBmangle\fR
.IP \fBraw\fR
.IP \fBsecurity\fR
.RE
.PP
\fITables\fR include \fIChains\fR. We consider that there are two types of
\fIChains\fR: (1) system defined chains (such as \fBINPUT\fR) and (2) user
defined chains. At the moment, all chains have to be explicitly defined
before they can be referenced.
.PP
All tables do not support all system defined chains. Here is a table of
the system defined chains are and the tables in which they can be used:
.RS
.TP 15
.B Chains
.B Corresponding Tables
.TP 15
.B FORWARD
filter mangle security
.TP 15
.B INPUT
filter nat mangle security
.TP 15
.B OUTPUT
filter nat mangle raw security
.TP 15
.B PREROUTING
nat mangle raw
.TP 15
.B POSTROUTING
nat mangle
.RE
.PP
User defined chains cannot reuse those names in any table.
.PP
\fIChains\fR include \fISections\fR. \fISections\fB are a concept introduced
by \fBipload(1)\fR to give you a way to group rules instead of having them
all sorted with just \fBbefore = ...\fR and \fBafter = ...\fR parameters.
.PP
Finally, \fISections\fR include \fIRules\fR. \fBRules\fR are the actual
rules that appear in your \fBiptables(8)\fR, however, one \fBipload(1)\fR
rule may result in zero to many \fBiptables(8)\fR rules.
.PP
Here is a tree like representation of those definitions:
.RS
.IP \fBTables\fP
.RS
.IP \fBChains\fP
.RS
.IP \fBSections\fP
.RS
.IP \fBRules\fP

.SH TABLES
The \fBipload(1)\fR command reads all the configurations files. It then
look for tables, chains, sections, and rules (as defined in the ORGANIZATION
section above).
.PP
The default configuration files already defined all the available tables.

.SH CHAINS
Like with tables, the default system chains are all defined in the default
configuration files. The \fBipload(1)\fR tool also defined two user chains:

.TP
\fBbad_packets\fR
To list a default set of IP addresses that is not supported on your system
such as 10.x.x.x (i.e. if you use 192.168.x.x, then you can as well block
all traffic on 10.x.x.x).

It happens that some hackers simulate those IP addresses in an attempt to
directly connect to a service on your LAN. The IP protocol is such that there
is no good way to prevent such attempts except through your firewall.

.TP
\fBunwanted\fR
This chain is used to add all the unwanted IP addresses and block them with
a \fBDROP\fI. In the new scheme, we actually use an IP set instead of the
\fBunwanted\fR chain. However, the chain is still available. I have a few
cases where some IP address is just plain bad \fIforeever\fR and I add these
directly in this chain. (And yes, those bad IPs, I tried to remove them from
my firewall and the hits started coming strong again... some such servers
are there to stay around forever.)

.SH "SECTIONS"
As mentioned above, \fISections\fR are a concept in \fBipload(1)\fR only.
This allows us to create groups of rules that get sorted as per the sorting
order of the sections.
.PP
A \fISection\fR is sorted compared to another \fISection\fR using the
\fBbefore = ...\fR and \fBafter = ...\fR parameters.
.PP
By default, we offer five sections sorted in this order:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
header
.IP \(bu 2
early_content
.IP \(bu 2
content
.IP \(bu 2
late_content
.IP \(bu 2
footer
.RE
.PP
In most likelihood, you won't need additional sections.
.PP
The \fBcontent\fR section is marked as being the default. This means rules
that do not defined a \fBsection = ...\fR parameter end up in that section.
You can detect when that happens using the \fB\-\-verbose\fR command
line option.

.SH "RULES"
The rules define the actual firewall rules. Contrary to the \fBiptables(8)\fR
rules, our rules do not require advance knowledge of all the command line
options. Instead of offer a \fIfew\fR parameters that you can set with
various values and you end up with the rules as required by \fBiptables(8)\fR.
Not only that, some of the parameters generate a product, meaning that it
can end up generating multiple. For example, if you define two chains, two
interfaces and three sources in one \fBipload(1)\fR rule, you end up with
2 x 2 x 3 = 12 rules in \fBiptables(8)\fR.
.PP
Rules should be assigned a \fBsection = ...\fR parameter. When that
parameter is not defined, the rule is assigned to the default section.
.PP
The \fBbefore = ...\fR and \fBafter = ...\fR parameters of the rules can
reference rules in a different section. In that case, the reference is
ignored. This is useful because the same rule may be reused by different
chains and the before/after parameter may work for that one chain and not
another.
.PP
Rules can include a \fBcondition = ...\fR to dynamically define whether the
rule should be included or not. At the moment, the condition is limited to
whether two strings are equal or not equal. This is still very useful since
we can then test whether a variable is set. If not set, skip that rule.
.PP
The following is the list of available parameters supported by the rules
blocks:

.TP
\fBaction = <action>\fR (required)
Define what the rule shall do when it is a match. There is no default action.
In other words, this parameter is mandatory. The supported actions are:

.RS 14
.IP "ACCEPT or ALLOW"
.IP "CALL <chain-name>"
.IP "DNAT <destination>"
.IP "DROP or DENY or BLACKHOLE"
.IP "LOG"
.IP "MASQUERADE"
.IP "REDIRECT <port>"
.IP "REJECT [<icmp-type>]"
.IP "RETURN"
.IP "SNAT <source>"
.RE

.IP
The \fBALLOW\fR, \fBDENY\fR, and \fBBLACKHOLE\fR are synonyms. They are not
recommended.

The \fBCALL\fR action must be followed by a valid chain name. When that rule
matches, then the specified "<chain-name>" gets called and executed. It
must be a user defined chain name.

The \fBDNAT\fR and \fBSNAT\fR expect a destination and a source IP address.

The \fBREDIRECT\fR expects a port. This allows you to change the local
destination port. The call does not see that redirection.

The \fBREJECT\fR can optionally be given an ICMP type to use to reject the
message. In most cases, you want to use "icmp-port-unreachable", which is
the default. ipload tries to match the name to IPv4 or IPv6, however, some
names are not compatible. The available names are:
.RS 14
.IP "\fBicmp6-no-route\fR or \fBno-route\fR (IPv6 only)"
.IP "\fBicmp6-adm-prohibited\fR or \fBicmp-adm-prohibited\fR or \fBadm-prohibited\fR (first IPv6 only)"
.IP "\fBicmp6-addr-unreachable\fR or \fBaddr-unreach\fR (IPv6 only)"
.IP "\fBicmp6-port-unreachable\fR or \fBicmp-port-unreachable\fR (first IPv6 only, \fIthis is the default\fR for both IPv4 and IPv6)"
.IP "\fBicmp-net-unreachable\fR or \fBnet-unreachable\fR (IPv4 only)"
.IP "\fBicmp-net-prohibited\fR or \fBnet-prohibited\fR (IPv4 only)"
.IP "\fBicmp-host-unreachable\fR or \fBhost-unreachable\fR (IPv4 only)"
.IP "\fBicmp-host-prohibited\fR or \fBhost-prohibited\fR (IPv4 only)"
.IP "\fBicmp-proto-unreachable\fR or \fBproto-unreachable\fR (IPv4 only)"
.IP "\fBtcp-reset\fR or \fBicmp-tcp-reset\fR"
.RE

.IP
Note: Some synonyms are our own extensions. The "icmp-" introducer is
generally not required.

.TP
\fBafter = <rule-name>\fR
Define the name of a rule this rule has to appear after. This enforces an
order. If no "<rule-name>" is found within this rule's section, then the
parameter is simply ignored.

.TP
\fBbefore = <rule-name>\fR
Define the name of a rule this rule has to appear before. This enforces an
order. If no "<rule-name>" is found within this rule's section, then the
parameter is simply ignored.

.TP
\fBcomment = <comment>\fR
Add a comment to the rule. This comment is kept in the actual iptables.
It can be useful if you want to use the ipload as a helper tool to generate
your rules and then save them using the "iptables-save" command.

.TP
\fBknocks = [<protocol>:]<port>, ...\fR
Add one or more knock ports along this rule. This is particularly useful
to hide your administrative services such as SSH and a website port which
should only be accessed by administrators.

It is most effective for TCP services where you can establish a connection
and keep it up and running. Services like HTTP/1.0 where a new connection
is required each time you want to access data, it can becomes tedious (i.e.
you have to repeat the knocking process each time you want to access that
HTTP server). Newer HTTP protocols (i.e. v2 and v3) allow for existing
connections to be used for long period of time and these will be viewed
as established for a while.

The iplock package installs a command line tool called knock-knock which
you want to use to open your ports. Simply repeat the same list of protocols
and ports on that command line, and it will open access to your service.

.TP
\fBTODO = <value>\fR
Add other parameters...

.SH "VARIABLES"
Any of the configuration files can include a \fB[variables]\fR declaration.
The variables are simple \fIname = value\fR.

The rules, sections, chains, and tables may include variables in their
parameters. Variables are referenced using the \fB${<varname>}\fR syntax.
These can appear between quotes or just as is.

Note that the variables only work on the right hand side of a parameter
definition (i.e. in the value, not as the name of the parameter).

The default variables are defined under
\fI/usr/share/iplock/general/variables.conf\fR.

.SS "Dynamic Variables"
Some of the available variables are dynamically assigned by \fBipload(1)\fR.
These variables can be used like any others and also overwritten.

TODO: actually implement such variables (i.e. list of interfaces and IP
addresses on those interfaces).

.SS "Global Variables"
The system also supports a few global variables.

The global variables are defined under
\fI/usr/share/iplock/general/global.conf\fR.

.TP
\fBlog_introducer\fR
The log introducer is prepended to all the \fBiptables(8)\fR rules using
the \fBLOG\fR target. We reuse this introducer in our file,
\fI/etc/rsyslog.d/01-iptables.conf\fR, to capture those logs and send them
to a separate file (under \fB/var/log/iptables/...\fR).

It is unlikely that you would want to change this introducer.

.TP
\fBcreate_set\fR
The system command line to be used to create an \fBipset(8)\fR. The
\fBipload(1)\fR command transforms any instances of \fB[name]\fR with
the name of the set it is attempting to create.

Note that \fBipload(1)\fR always attempts to create the set.
The command should use a condition to avoid errors if the set already
exists. At this time, this is the \fB\-exist\fR command line option.

.TP
\fBremove_user_chain\fR
The \fBiptables-restore(8)\fR and \fBip6tables-restore(8)\fR commands
automatically create new user chains. The \fB\-\-flush\fR command line
option can be used to completely flush the firewall and that includes
removing all user defined chains. This variable includes the command
to be used to remove that user chain.

Note that \fBipload(1)\fR always attempts to remove the user chain.
The command should include a conition to not return an error if the
chain does not exist. This is currently done using the \fB\-\-list\fR
command line option. If that does not fail, the chain exists and it
gets removed.

This command has any instances of \fB[name]\fR replaced by the name of
the chain being removed. Similarly, it replaces \fB[table]\fR with the
name of the table in which that chain has to be deleted.
